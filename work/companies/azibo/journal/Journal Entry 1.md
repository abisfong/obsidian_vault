I find myself a bit stressed about the structure of our codebase more often lately. It distracts me from work because it's discouraging and stressful. I tend to look at my phone during these times. I shouldn't do that though, because it builds on an old bad habit I had in college, where I would use my phone to distract myself when work got tough.
