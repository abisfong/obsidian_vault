- **Order Workflow**: Set up a process for taking orders, confirming designs, and printing. Consider offering quick turnaround options for urgent orders.
- **Software**: Use 3D modeling software (e.g., Fusion 360, Tinkercad) for custom designs. You may also need slicing software to prepare models for printing (e.g., Cura, PrusaSlicer).
- **Quality Control**: Ensure consistent product quality by testing prototypes and setting standards for print accuracy, material strength, and finish.
- **Shipping and Packaging**: Invest in protective packaging for fragile prints and set up affordable shipping methods, both locally and internationally.
- **Customer Support**: Offer support for custom requests and ensure smooth communication with clients throughout the project lifecycle.
