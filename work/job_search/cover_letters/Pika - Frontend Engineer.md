Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Frontend Engineer role at Pika. With my strong expertise in frontend development and a deep passion for creating seamless, scalable user experiences across platforms, I believe I can contribute to Pika’s mission of transforming video creation through cutting-edge technology.

In my current role as a **Founding Frontend Engineer at Azibo**, I led the development of cross-platform applications that streamlined the user experience for property management. By optimizing the performance and scalability of our web app, I successfully accelerated adoption rates and improved overall client satisfaction. My extensive experience with **JavaScript, React, and CSS** has equipped me with the technical skills necessary to build responsive designs that adapt across varying screen sizes while maintaining high performance and efficiency.

Pika’s mission to harness AI and lower the barriers to video creation resonates with my own desire to build inclusive and innovative digital solutions. I am particularly drawn to the opportunity to collaborate with your UX/UI designers to craft user interfaces that are not only visually appealing but also highly functional and responsive. Having worked in fast-paced, collaborative environments, I’m confident that my problem-solving skills and ability to implement responsive design principles will enable me to contribute effectively to Pika’s goals.

I am excited about the prospect of joining Pika’s talented team and leveraging my skills to help drive the future of accessible video creation. I look forward to the opportunity to further discuss how my background and expertise align with your needs.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Abraham Fong
