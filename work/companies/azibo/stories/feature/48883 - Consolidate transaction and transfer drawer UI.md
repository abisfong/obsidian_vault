## Questions
- Questions for meeting with Ankur and Assel
	- Recipient details
		- Ankur
			- Where can I find the institution name?
				- Can be found in recipient information via recipient API
		- Assel
			- What is institution name?
				- From recipient information
- Questions for meeting with JVL and Assel
	- Transaction details
		- All transfers have to and from account data. Do we want to do anything with the extra data in the drawers we're not using it?
	- Recipient details
		- Is the recipient the person receiving the transfer
	- Bookkeeping 
		- Notes/memo
			- Transfers do not have memo or notes at the moment. This will be updated by Ankur, but not in this iteration. Do we hide the data for now and leave the bookkeeping inputs?
			- Transactions have both notes and memos. At the moment, we're collecting notes, and then displaying it as the memo. Should we change their labels to match so the user doesn't get confused?
		- Unit
			- Transfers don't have unit data
	- Vendor/tenant and recipient details
		- Who will this be on transfers? The recipient?
