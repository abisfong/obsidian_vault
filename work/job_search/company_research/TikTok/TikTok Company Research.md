## Technology
Technology is essential to TikTok's content discovery process and creation tools, including special effects, stickers, and other video editing tools. The "For You" feed, for example, offers curated video recommendations that are personalized to each user based on their preferences. Each user's feed highlights content catered to them, rather than prioritizing videos from the platformâ€™s largest influencers. With this technology, TikTok opens the door for more users to become successful creators and reach new, wider, global audiences.

### Effect House
Effect House is a powerful AR tool that makes it easy to create, publish, and share high-quality augmented effects, also known as, filters, for TikTok. Made with both beginner and advanced designers and developers in mind, Effect House empowers creators to build interactive experiences for TikTok users around the world.

### Ads
#### Top View
Top View involves interactive, full-screen ads that cover the interface of the TikTok app and last for up to 60 seconds. This format not only projects a clear brand message, but also enhances engagement by appearing at the moment of highest anticipation (when the app is first opened).

#### In-Feed Ads
Target and reach users in their personalized "For You" feeds, where In-Feed Ads fit seamlessly alongside user-generated content. Users can click through to visit the TikTok shop or the advertiser's website or account. In-Feed Ads are based on return on investment (ROI) and advertisers can easily track performance.

#### Hashtag Challenge
By inviting TikTok users to engage with brand-friendly music and actions, Hashtag Challenges increase user engagement and help build bonds between brands and users. They are also a great way to create a viral marketing campaign.

#### Branded Effect
Branded Effects are custom, sponsored effects commissioned by brands giving them the opportunity to connect with audiences in a meaningful, native, and uniquely-TikTok format. These effects are highly customized, with brand logos and other branded elements, to fit their specific campaign needs.
