## Recruiter Screening
### Common Questions From Recruiter
- **Tell Me About Yourself**: Prepare a concise summary of your background, focusing on your journey into software engineering, your current role, and what excites you about the opportunity at Meta.
	- I earned my degree in CS from UC Santa Cruz, becoming the first in my family to graduate from a four-year university. I'm very proud and very thankful for that. After college, I faced some challenges in landing a job, largely due to not securing an internship during my studies and the impact of COVID-19. To overcome this, I joined App Academy, where I honed my skills in web development and successfully landed a role as a Founding Frontend Software Engineer at Azibo. In this position, I’ve gained extensive experience with React, TypeScript, CSS, and more. I have also led the replatforming of the company's web application, and maintained and developed critical features. I’m passionate about using technology to create positive change, especially for underserved communities, like the ones I grew up in, and I’m excited about the opportunity to bring my unique perspective and skills to Meta through the Pathways Program.
- **Why Meta?**: Think about what attracts you to Meta specifically—consider their culture, their commitment to innovation, and their impact on the tech world.
	- I'm particularly drawn to Meta because of its commitment to innovation and its mission to bring people closer together through technology. Meta’s work in connecting billions of users globally aligns with my passion for creating software that has a meaningful impact on people’s lives. Additionally, Meta’s focus on building diverse and inclusive teams is something that resonates deeply with me, as I believe that diverse perspectives lead to better solutions. The opportunity to grow my career at a company that’s leading the way in the tech industry is incredibly exciting, and I’m eager to contribute to Meta’s continued success.
- **Why the Pathways Program?**: Be ready to explain why this program is a good fit for you and how it aligns with your career goals.
	- The Pathways Program at Meta is a perfect fit for me because it’s designed for individuals with non-traditional backgrounds, like mine. My journey into software engineering hasn’t been straightforward, but it has equipped me with resilience, adaptability, and a deep passion for learning. I’m excited about the structured training and mentorship that the Pathways Program offers, which will allow me to continue growing my technical skills while contributing to Meta’s innovative projects. I see this program as an opportunity to leverage my existing skills and experience while also expanding my knowledge in new areas, ultimately preparing me for a long-term career at Meta.
- **Strengths and Weaknesses**: Be prepared to discuss your key strengths, especially those relevant to the role, and how you’re working on any weaknesses.
	- Strength: One of my key strengths is my problem-solving ability. In my current role, I’ve led the replatforming of a major web application, which involved tackling complex technical challenges and finding innovative solutions. I’m also highly adaptable, having transitioned from struggling to find a job after college to becoming a key contributor at a tech startup. Additionally, my background as a first-generation immigrant has instilled in me a strong work ethic and perseverance, which I bring to every project I work on.
	- Weakness: One area I’m working on is deepening my experience with backend technologies and data processing. While I have strong frontend development skills, I recognize that having a more holistic understanding of full-stack development would make me an even more effective engineer. I’ve started taking online courses and working on side projects to build my knowledge in this area, and I’m eager to continue developing these skills, particularly through opportunities like the Pathways Program at Meta.
- **Career Goals**: Be clear about your short-term and long-term career goals and how Meta’s Pathways Program fits into those plans.
	- In the short term, my goal is to continue building my technical skills and gain more experience working on large-scale projects, particularly in an innovative and structured environment like Meta’s. I’m excited about the opportunity to learn from some of the best engineers in the industry through Meta and to contribute to impactful projects that reach a global audience. Long term, I aspire to take on more leadership responsibilities, potentially leading teams or projects that focus on developing technology solutions for underserved communities. Ultimately, I want to use my skills to make a meaningful difference in the world, and I believe Meta is the perfect place to achieve that.
- What is a project you're most proud of
	- I’m most proud of a project where I led the replatforming of the company web app at Azibo. The goal of this project was to migrate our existing web application to a more modern tech stack, specifically using React and TypeScript, to improve performance, maintainability, and scalability. As the lead frontend engineer, I was responsible for redesigning the user interface, ensuring that the new platform was both user-friendly and aligned with our business objectives.
	  
	  One of the biggest challenges was maintaining the functionality of legacy features while integrating new technologies. This required close collaboration with cross-functional teams, including backend developers, designers, and product managers. I also had to ensure that the transition was seamless for our users, with minimal downtime and disruptions.
	  
	  The outcome was highly successful. The replatformed app not only improved the site’s performance by 30%, which we measured through **response time, load times, and error rates**, but also enhanced user satisfaction, as evidenced by positive feedback and increased engagement metrics, which we measured through Hotspot and Pendo. Furthermore, we successfully created the first in app revenue streams, increasing our monthly platform revenue from less then $30k in March of 2022, to $119k in July of 2024. This project taught me the importance of thorough planning, effective communication, and the ability to adapt to new challenges quickly. It’s a project that not only advanced my technical skills but also reinforced my commitment to delivering high-quality software that meets both user needs and business goals.
