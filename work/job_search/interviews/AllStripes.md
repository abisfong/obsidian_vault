Jon Tips
- Its not too late to do an internship
- volunteer work looks great but be wary
- **make sure that the company provides a mentor**
- make sure they stick with you for at least 2 weeks
- how do you support onboarding engineers
- do a little bit of homework for company
- ask about the company product
- try to make your first job with a tech company
- signs of a tech company
- job is for a developer not an engineer
- no methodologies
- developer/engineer —> look for this (developer is a bad sign)
- code shredder
- find aA cohort mates that kick butt and team up with them
- learning to generalize is good
- books
- If I could help guide you through the perfect path:
- 2 years at big company
- 2 years at small startup
- 2 years in between that spectrum (startup with over 100 people maybe?)
