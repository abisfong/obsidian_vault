### Homie
#### About
**We build things that push the boundaries of what is possible:** Homie is pioneering a paradigm shift for consumer applications in the age of AI. We create products that challenge the status quo and redefine what it means to socialize digitally.

**We are a team of technical founders:** Everyone on this team is hyper ambitious and technical. The founders were early engineers at Sequoia backed consumer unicorns. We look for people who care about their technical craft but are equally pragmatic. We prioritize prototyping quickly as the vast majority of the technical challenges we face require bespoke solutions.

**We are backed by world class investors:** We’ve raised 3.1M from Keith Rabois at **Khosla Ventures, OpenAI Fund**, and angels like Naveen Rao (CEO of MosaicML) and Surabhi Gupta (VP of Eng at Robinhood)

#### Questions
- What does your ideal next role look like? 
	- My ideal next role is one where I can combine my technical expertise with a genuine passion for creating impactful digital experiences. I’m particularly interested in a role where I can take on backend challenges, contribute to the architectural foundation of the product, and play a pivotal part in shaping the product roadmap. I’d love to be part of a collaborative, innovative team where my contributions directly influence the user experience and drive the company’s growth. Additionally, I’m seeking a position that offers room for professional development, allowing me to broaden my skills in areas like leadership and AI.
- Why are you interested in joining an early stage startup?
	- I’m drawn to the energy and innovation of early-stage startups because of the unique opportunity they offer to make a tangible impact from day one. I find it incredibly motivating to work on a product that’s evolving rapidly and to have a role where I can contribute to both the technology and the broader strategic direction of the company. Working at an early-stage social media startup is especially exciting because it allows me to be part of a team that’s redefining how people connect and interact online. I believe in the power of social media to bring people together, and I’m eager to be part of a team that’s pushing boundaries, taking risks, and creating solutions that are responsive to users’ needs. Plus, I enjoy the collaborative and hands-on environment that’s typical of startups, where cross-functional work and real-time feedback are part of the everyday experience.
